    <a>About Me:</a><br>
    <p>Hi, I’m Hiral Gupta, and I’m currently learning web development. I’ve recently started my journey into coding, and I’m building this portfolio website as one of my first projects.

I’m focusing on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m excited to keep learning how to create responsive, user-friendly websites.

This portfolio is a space to document my progress, share what I build, and grow as a developer. I’m passionate about problem-solving and turning ideas into real, working websites.

Thanks for stopping by — I’m just getting started, and there’s more to come!</p>
